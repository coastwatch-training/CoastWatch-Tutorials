# Matchup Satellite data to track locations

history | Modified July 2024

## Objective

This tutorial will demonstrate how to extract satellite data around a set of points defined by longitude, latitude, and time coordinates from ab animal telemetry tag that was acquired from the Animal Telemetry Network (https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/atn/).

## The tutorial demonstrates the following techniques

-   Importing track data in csv file to data frame
-   Plotting the latitude/longitude points onto a map
-   Using rerddapXtraco function to extract satellite data from an ERDDAP data server along a track
-   Plotting the satellite data onto a map

## Datasets used in this exercise

**Chlorophyll a concentration, the European Space Agency's Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) Monthly dataset v6.0**

We'll use the European Space Agency's OC-CCI product (<https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/ocean-colour/>) to obtain chlorophyll data.
This is a merged product combining data from many ocean color sensors to create a long time series (1997-present).

**Yellowfin tuna telemetry track data**

Marine protected areas (MPAs) in pelagic regions is also called Blue Water. The Palmyra Bluewater Research (PBR) project seeks to understand the impact of MPAs on species and ecosystems by tracking at-sea movements of ten marine animal species at Palmyra Atoll (part of the U.S. Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument). All data were being collected from adult individuals between May 2022 and June 2023. They can be accessed via the Animal Telemetry Network (ATN) data portal for the PBR project under "Project Data": (<https://portal.atn.ioos.us/?ls=861Wqpd2#metadata/1f877c4c-7b50-49f5-be86-3354664e0cff/project/files>)

The yellowfin tuna geolocation data is developed as part of the PBR project. This example track used in the tutorial is from May 2022 to November 2022. The track data has been previously downloaded, extracted, and stored in the data folder of this training module.

## Install required packages and load libraries

```{r install,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

# Function to check if pkgs are installed, and install any missing pkgs
pkgTest <- function(x)
{
  if (!require(x,character.only = TRUE))
  {
    install.packages(x,dep=TRUE,repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
    if(!require(x,character.only = TRUE)) stop(x, " :Package not found")
  }
}


# Create list of required packages
list.of.packages <- c("rerddap", "plotdap", "parsedate", "ggplot2", "rerddapXtracto",
                       "date", "maps", "mapdata", "RColorBrewer","viridis", "stringr")

# Create list of installed packages
pkges = installed.packages()[,"Package"]

# Install and load all required pkgs
for (pk in list.of.packages) {
  pkgTest(pk)
}

```

## Download animal track data from the ATN website  

* __The data you need for this exercise are already in the GitHub repository__

* __The following step are show you how to download the data yourself__



### ATN Portal  

* Follow the link to the ATN website: https://portal.atn.ioos.us/?ls=O6vlufm7#map  
* On the right navigational panel, look for the "Palmyra Bluewater Research (PBR) Megafauna Movement Ecology Project, 2022-2023" tab.
* Within the tab, scroll to find the telemetry tag labeled "Yellowfin tuna (233568)". 
* Click the search icon (maginifying glass) label next to the label to zoom into the area the area of the animal track. 

![Image of the ATN portal webpage](images_ATN/atn_map.png)

### Detail page for the Yellowfin tuna (233568)  

* Next click the tag icon to the right of the search icon. 
* This page shows you details about the animal and the track. 

![Image of the detail page for the Yellowfin Tuna #233568](images_ATN/atn_detail.png)

### Data Download Page  

* Press the "Project Data" tab near the top of the webpage to bring up the data file list. 
* Search for the animal id number (233568). 
* Click on the link "THUALB_2022_04-PTT_233568.zip (8.6 MB)" to download the data.

![Data download page](images_ATN/atn_data.png)

### The Downloaded Data File  

* The download will be a zip file. You will need to unzip it. 
* The unzipped file folder contains many ancillary data files, but the one you are looking for is the CSV file (THUALB_2022_04-233568-4-GPE3.csv). 
* You don't have to move this file into the data folder for this exercise. It is already there.   
* But if you download the file for a different animal track you would need to put the CSV file into the folder.  

## Import the track data into a data frame  

```{r track}
# Import csv file into a data frame
file = "../data/THUALB_2022_04-233568-5-GPE3.csv"
pre_tuna_df <- read.csv(file, skip = 5)

# Show 3 rows from the data frame
head(pre_tuna_df, 3)
# Convert longitudes to 0~360 (Re-center map to the dateline)
pre_tuna_df['Most.Likely.Longitude'] <- pre_tuna_df['Most.Likely.Longitude'] + 360
# Show converted data frame
head(pre_tuna_df, 3)
```

## Convert date string to a date object

```{r convert date}
pre_tuna_df$Date <- as.Date(pre_tuna_df$Date, format = "%d-%b-%Y")
head(pre_tuna_df)

```

## Bin multiple observations from each day into daily mean values

The track data has multiple longitude/latitude/time points for each date. That temporal resolution is much higher than the daily and month satellite datasets that are available. So, let's reduce the multiple daily values for the animal track data to a single value for each day. The code below creates a new dataframe that bins data for each date and calculates the mean for selected columns. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tuna_df <- pre_tuna_df %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarize(Most.Likely.Latitude = mean(Most.Likely.Latitude),
                                         Most.Likely.Longitude = mean(Most.Likely.Longitude),
                                         Satellite.SST = mean(Satellite.SST, na.rm=TRUE),
                                         Observed.SST = mean(Observed.SST, na.rm=TRUE),
                                         Observed.Depth = mean(Observed.Depth, na.rm=TRUE),
                                         Bathymetry.Depth = mean(Bathymetry.Depth, na.rm=TRUE),
                                         )

tuna_df

```

## Plot the track on a map

```{r trackplot}

# Download world map
mapWorld <- map_data("world", wrap=c(0,360))

# Map tuna tracks
ggplot(tuna_df, aes(Most.Likely.Longitude,Most.Likely.Latitude)) +
  geom_path(group=1)+
  geom_point(aes(x=Most.Likely.Longitude,y=Most.Likely.Latitude), pch=1, size=2 )+
  geom_point(aes(x=Most.Likely.Longitude[1],y=Most.Likely.Latitude[1]),fill="green", shape=24, size=3)+
  geom_point(aes(x=Most.Likely.Longitude[length(Most.Likely.Longitude)],y=Most.Likely.Latitude[length(Most.Likely.Latitude)]), shape=22, size=3, fill="red")+
  geom_polygon(data = mapWorld, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(180,220),ylim = c(0,26))+
  labs(x="Longitude (deg)", y="Latitude (deg)", title="Yellowfin Tuna Track with start (green) and end location (red)")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5), aspect.ratio=0.6)

```

In this exercise, two different ways of extracting data from ERDDAP data server along a track of xyt points are demonstrated:

1.  Using the **rerddapXtracto** package which was written specifically for this task
2.  For those who want to know what goes on "under the hood", we will show how to manually construct ERDDAP data-request URLs to download the data. 

### Extracting XYT data using the **rerddapXtracto** package

We will use the \``rxtracto` function of the **rerddapXtracto** package, which was written to simplify data extraction from ERDDAP servers.

**Let's use data from the monthly product of the OC-CCI datasets.**\

Ideally, we would work with daily data since we have one location per day.
But chlorophyll data are severely affected by clouds (i.e. lots of missing data), so you might need to use weekly or even monthly data to get sufficient non-missing data. We will start with the monthly chl-a data since it contains fewer data gaps.  

The ERDDAP URL to the monthly product is below:\
<https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/esa-cci-chla-monthly-v6-0>

**A note on dataset selection**\
We have preselected the dataset because we know it will work with this exercise.
If you were selecting datasets on your own, you would want to check out the dataset to determine if its spatial and temporal coverages are suitable for your application.
Following the link above you will find:

The latitude range is -89.97916 to 89.97916 and the longitude range is 0.020833 to 359.97916, which covers the track latitude range of 23.72 to 41.77 and longitude range of 175.86 to 248.57.

The time range is 1997-09-04 to 2023-12-01 (at the day of this writing), which covers the track time range of 2022-05-30 to 2023-01-18.

You should also note the name of the variable you will be downloading.
For this dataset it is "**chlor_a**"

```{r datainfo}

# Set dataset ID
dataset <- 'esa-cci-chla-monthly-v6-0'

# Get data information from ERDDAP server
dataInfo <- rerddap::info(dataset, url= "https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/erddap")

```

## Examine metadata

`rerddap::info` returns the metadata of the requested dataset.
We can first understand the attributes dataInfo includes then examine each attribute.

```{r metadata}
# Display the metadata
dataInfo

# Display data attributes
names(dataInfo)

# Examine attribute: variables
dataInfo$variables

# Distribute attributes of dataInfo$alldata
names(dataInfo$alldata)

```

### Extract data using the rxtracto function

First we need to define the bounding box within which to search for coordinates.
The **rxtracto** function allows you to set the size of the box used to collect data around the track points using the xlen and ylen arguments.
The values for xlen and ylen are in degrees.
For our example, we can use 0.2 degrees for both arguments.
Note: You can also submit vectors for xlen and ylen, as long as they are the same length as xcoord, ycoord, and tcoord if you want to set a different search radius around each track point.

```{r rxtracto, message=FALSE}

# Set the variable we want to extract data from:
parameter <- 'chlor_a'

# Set xlen, ylen to 0.2 degree
xlen <- 0.2 
ylen <- 0.2

# Create date column using year, month and day in a format ERDDAP will understand (eg. 2008-12-15)
#tuna_df$date <-as.Date(tuna_df$Date, format = "%d-%b-%Y")

# Get variables x, y, t coordinates from tuna track data
xcoords <- tuna_df$Most.Likely.Longitude
ycoords <- tuna_df$Most.Likely.Latitude
tcoords <- tuna_df$Date

# Extract satellite data using x, y, t coordinates from tuna track data
chl_track <- rxtracto(dataInfo, 
                  parameter=parameter, 
                  xcoord=xcoords, ycoord=ycoords, 
                  tcoord=tcoords, xlen=xlen, ylen=ylen)

```

## Check the output of the rxtracto function

```{r check_extracto}
# Check all variables extracted using rxtracto
str(chl_track)
```

**rxtracto** computes statistics using all the pixels found in the search radius around each track point.

## Plotting the results using plotTrack

We will use the "plotTrack" function to plot the results.
"plotTrack" is a function of the "rerddapXtracto" package designed specifically to plot the results of the "rxtracto" function.
It provides an easy way to make a quick plot, however it's not very customizable.

```{r chl track map 1}

# Plot tracks with color: algae specifically designed for chlorophyll
plotTrack(chl_track, xcoords, ycoords, tcoords, size=3, plotColor = 'viridis')

```

## Animating the track

One of the nice features of the "plotTrack" function is that it is very easy to make an animation of the track data.
This will take a minute to run.
It creates an animated gif that will display in the Rstudio viewer window once the encoding to gif is done. 
Note: this works with but doesn't require the latest versions of R Studio or rerddapXtracto package (e.g., it works with R Studio Version 2023.12.1+402 and rerddapXtracto version 1.1.5).

```{r animatetrack, message=FALSE}

# Animate tracks

make180 <- function(lon) {
    ind <- which(lon > 180)
    lon[ind] <- lon[ind] - 360
   return(lon)
}

plotTrack(chl_track,
          make180(xcoords),
          ycoords, tcoords,
          plotColor = 'viridis',
          animate = TRUE,
          cumulative = TRUE)
```

## Plotting the results using ggplot

### Create a data frame with the tuna track and the output of rxtracto

If we to do an customization of the plot, its better to plot the data using ggplot.
We will first create a data frame that contains longitudes and latitudes from the tuna and associated satellite chlor-a values.

```{r create dataframe}

# Create a data frame of coords from tuna and chlor_a values 
new_df <- as.data.frame(cbind(xcoords, ycoords,  
                              chl_track$`requested lon min`, 
                              chl_track$`requested lon max`, 
                              chl_track$`requested lat min`, 
                              chl_track$`requested lon max`,  
                              chl_track$`mean chlor_a`)
                        )

# Set variable names
names(new_df) <- c("Lon", 
                   "Lat", 
                   "Matchup_Lon_Lower",
                   "Matchup_Lon_Upper",
                   "Matchup_Lat_Lower",
                   "Matchup_Lat_Upper", 
                   "Chlor_a")

write.csv(new_df, "tuna_matchup_df.csv")

```

### Plot using ggplot

```{r ggplot_track}

# Import world map
mapWorld <- map_data("world", wrap=c(0,360))

# Draw the track positions with associated chlora values
ggplot(new_df) +
  geom_point(aes(Lon,Lat,color=log(Chlor_a))) +
  geom_polygon(data = mapWorld, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(180,220),ylim = c(0,26)) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = FALSE) +
  labs(x="Longitude (deg)", y="Latitude (deg)", title="Yellowfin Tuna Track with chlor-a values") +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

```

### Extracting XYT data by constructing the URL data requests manually

First we need to set up the ERDDAP URL using the datasets ID and the name of the variable we are interested in. Note that we are requesting the data as .csv

`data_url = "https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/esa-cci-chla-monthly-v6-0.csv?chlor_a"`

For a refresher of how to construct an ERDDAP data-request URL, please review the ERDDAP tutorial "04-Erddapurl.md" at the following link: https://github.com/coastwatch-training/CoastWatch-Tutorials/blob/main/ERDDAP-basics/lessons/

```{r manually create url for data extraction }
 
# Set erddap address
erddap_base_url <- "https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/esa-cci-chla-monthly-v6-0.csv?chlor_a"

# Get longitude and latitude from tuna track data
lon <- tuna_df$Most.Likely.Longitude
lat <- tuna_df$Most.Likely.Latitude

# Get time from tuna track data and convert into ERDDAP date format
dates2 <- as.Date(tuna_df$Date, format = "%d-%b-%Y")

# Initatilize tot variable where data will be downloaded to
tot <- rep(NA, 4)

# Loop through each tuna track data
for (i in 1:dim(tuna_df)[1]) {

  # follow the progress of the loop
  cat("\014")
  cat(" Loop ", i, " of ", dim(tuna_df)[1])
  
  # Create erddap URL by adding lat, lon, dates of each track point 
   url <-  paste(erddap_base_url,
                 "[(", dates2[i], "):1:(", dates2[i],
                 ")][(", lat[i], "):1:(", lat[i],
                 ")][(", lon[i], "):1:(", lon[i], ")]", sep = "")  
   
   # Request and load satelite data from ERDDAP
   new <- read.csv(url, skip=2, header = FALSE) 
   
   # Append the data
   tot <- rbind(tot, new)   
   
}

# Delete the first row (default column names)
tot <- tot[-1, ]

# Rename columns
names(tot) <- c("chlo_date", "matched_lat", "matched_lon", "matched_chl.m")

# Create data frame combining tuna track data and the chlo-a data
chl_track2 <- data.frame(tuna_df, tot)

# Write the data frame to csv file
write.csv(chl_track2, 'tuna-track-chl.m.csv', row.names = FALSE)

```

### Make a map of the data extracted using ggplot

```{r ggplot_track 2}


# Draw the track positions with associated chlora values
ggplot(chl_track2) +
  geom_point(aes(Most.Likely.Longitude,Most.Likely.Latitude,color=log(matched_chl.m))) +
  geom_polygon(data = mapWorld, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(180,220),ylim = c(0,26)) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = FALSE) +
  labs(x="Longitude (deg)", y="Latitude (deg)", title="Yellowfin Tuna Track with chlor-a values")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

```

### Plot histogram of chlorophyll

How do the chlorophyll values of the tuna track compare to values in the surrounding environment?
Meaning does the tuna seem to have a preference for certain chlorophyll values?
To look at this we will plot a histograms of the track chl valuesand those of the surrounding area.

First we will get a 3D block of chl data from the region and of the tuna track over the span of time the tuna was in that area.
We will use the 'xtracto_3d' function of rerddapXtracto to get the data.
This data call will take a few minutes.

```{r get grid of chlorophyll data }


chl_grid <- rxtracto_3D(dataInfo, 
                  parameter=parameter, 
                  xcoord=c(min(xcoords),max(xcoords)), 
                  ycoord=c(min(ycoords),max(ycoords)), 
                  tcoord=c(min(tcoords),max(tcoords)))

chl_area <- as.vector(chl_grid$chlor_a) 

# remove NA values 
chl_area <- chl_area[!is.na(chl_area)]

# vector or tuna chlorophyll 

chl_tuna <- chl_track$`mean chlor_a`


```

Now we we plot histograms of all the chlorphyll values in the area, and those of the tuna track.


```{r Plot histogram of chlorophyll}

ggplot(as.data.frame(chl_area)) + 
      geom_histogram(aes(x=chl_area,y=after_stat(density),color = "darkgray",fill='Area'),color='black', bins=50) + 
      geom_histogram(data=as.data.frame(chl_tuna), aes(x=chl_tuna,y=after_stat(density),color='green', fill='Tuna'),color='black',bins=50, alpha=.4) + 
      scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,.9), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,15), expand = c(0, 0)) +
      labs(x='Chlorophyll values',y='Density') + 
      theme_bw() + 
      scale_fill_manual(values=c("darkgray","green"),'')
  

```

##### Exercise 1:

Repeat the steps above with a different satellite dataset.
For example, extract sea surface temperature data using the following dataset: <https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisGeoPolarSSTN5NRT_Lon0360.html> \\\* This dataset is a different ERDDAP, so remember to change the base URL.
\\\* Set the new dataset ID and variable name.

##### Exercise 2:

Go to an ERDDAP of your choice, find a dataset of interest, generate the URL, copy it and edit the script above to run a match up on that dataset.
To find other ERDDAP servers, you can use this search engine: <http://erddap.com/> \\\* This dataset will likely be on a different ERDDAP, so remember to change the base URL.
\\\* Set the new dataset ID and variable name.
\\\* Check the metadata to make sure the dataset covers the spatial and temporal range of the track dataset.

##### Optional

Repeat the steps above with a daily version of the OC-CCI dataset to see how cloud cover can reduce the data you retrieve.
